# Layout

It is important to me that this project be somewhat organized. I understand that it is perilous to attempt and plan everything in advanced and I do not wish to do that. 

However, for now I would like to follow this format:

```
linux-kernel-programming-lessons/
│
├── admin/                          # Administrative documents
│   ├── schedule.md                 # Project schedule and deadlines
│   └── README.md                   # Overview of administrative documents
│   └── layout.md                   # That's me
│
├── lessons/                        # Lesson content
│   ├── lesson1/                    # Individual lesson directories
│   │   ├── lesson1.md              # Lesson content (Markdown format)
│   │   └── code/                   # Code examples for Lesson 1
│   ├── lesson2/
│   │   ├── lesson2.md
│   │   └── code/
│   ├── ...                        # Other lesson directories
│   └── README.md                   # Overview of lessons and links to individual lessons
│
├── docs/                           # Project documentation

│
└── README.md                       # Project overview and instructions for getting started
```
